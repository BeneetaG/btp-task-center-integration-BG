SAP Mobile Start is the native mobile entry point to SAP’s Intelligent Enterprise: it is the mobile representation of the SAP Launchpad service (which is a prerequisite), leveraging mobile native capabilities (such as notification, widgets, spotlight search and others). SAP Mobile Start provides an optimized access to all your business applications (native or web) and information on your mobile device, enabling you to take appropriate business critical decisions in any circumstances.
