## SAP's Integration Startegy
In 2020, we first communicated [SAP’s Integration Plan in the Cloud](https://www.sap.com/docs/download/2020/02/520ea921-847d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.pdf) that describes distinct suite qualities for an integrated intelligent suite. These suite qualities are the targeted attributes of SAP applications that are integrated out-of-the-box. Significant effort has been – and is continuously being invested – to deliver on these suite qualities that are relevant and important for the whole SAP portfolio.

One workflow inbox is a prominent example for a suite quality and targets an integrated solution that allows to handle all the approval tasks from different applications in just one central place. It is now provided as an SAP Business Technology Platform service, [SAP Task Center service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/TASK_CENTER/Cloud/en-US) and its respective application.
[One workflow inbox suite quality](https://d.dam.sap.com/a/L1FvTeb)  and the resulting SAP Task Center solution rely on standards, that are in the end also suite qualities like:

- The suite quality coordinated lifecycle management
- The unified user identity (UUID) that is part of our [suite quality security and identity management](https://d.dam.sap.com/a/XpmTQ2a)
