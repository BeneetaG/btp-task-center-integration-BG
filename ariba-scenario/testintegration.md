<p ="text-align: left;">After configuring your Destination services for SAP Ariba, you need to test the integration. You can do by troubleshooting the SAP Task Center API with Postman. This will let you know if there are connectivity issues. If you have a successful connection with Postman, run the tasks and see if they appear in Task Center. If they are not appearing, then it could be an issue with the IAS/IPS configuration. Please refer to the below blog for troubleshooting assistance. </p>
